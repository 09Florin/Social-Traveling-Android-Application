**Digital souvenirs collection**

The primary objective of this project is to incorporate the traveling experience of the users into digital souvenirs, represented by unique pieces of digital art that are unlocked by scanning a QR code at the corresponding tourist attraction.

The act of collecting these digital souvenirs fosters a sense of community among travelers, as it allows users to compare collections, engage in discussions about their travels, and recommend destinations based on personal experiences. This mechanism enhances the social dimension of the application by encouraging users to share their travel achievements and memories within their social circles.
